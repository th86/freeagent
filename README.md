This is a minimalist example of LLM-based chatbot using OpenRouter API and is hosted on Vercel. 

Before you start, you need: 
* a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) hobby account 
* an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) token
* a [Google Developer](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) API key and a Custom Search Engine ID

To launch your own chatbot:
1. Create a new project on Vercel by importing this repository.
2. Add your OpenRouter token in `Environment Variables` of the project as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
3. Add your Google API key as `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and Custom Search Engine ID as `GOOGLE_SEARCH_CX`.
4. Deploy the project.
